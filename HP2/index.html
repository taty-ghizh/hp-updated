                    <b> Gryffindor </b> is one of the four Houses of Hogwarts School and was founded by <em>Godric
                      Gryffindor</em>.
                    Gryffindor is said to have praised courage, determination and strength of heart above all other
                    qualities.
                    Indeed, he selected students for his house based upon their daring and bravery, according to the
                    Sorting Hat.
                    He also was the most in favour of allowing Muggle-borns into the school.
                    The emblematic animal is a <em>lion</em>, and its colors are <em>scarlet</em> and <em>gold</em>.
                    Gryffindor corresponds roughly to the element of fire, and it is for this reason
                    that the colors scarlet and gold were chosen to represent the house.

            Ravenclaw is one of the four Houses of Hogwarts School. 
            Its founder was the medieval witch Rowena Ravenclaw.
            It is a popular historical theory that the location and name of Hogwarts were both chosen by Rowena, 
            who dreamt that a warty hog was leading her to a cliff by the lake. 
            She also came up with the ever-changing floor plan. <br>
            Rowena selected her students according to intelligence and wisdom. 
            Ravenclaw House therefore values a sharp mind, wisdom, creativity, and cleverness in its members.
            <br>Ravenclaw corresponds roughly to the element of air, 
            and it is for that reason that the House colours were chosen; 
            blue and bronze represent the sky and eagle feathers respectively,
            both having much to do with air.

                    Slytherin is one of the four Houses at of Hogwarts School, founded by Salazar Slytherin. 
                    He was a pure-blood wizard, was regarded as one of the greatest wizards of the age, respectively as a Parselmouth and as a skilled Legilimens. 
                    When sorting the most valued characteristics are cunning, resourcefulness, leadership, ambition and blood purity. He mistrusted Muggle-born students to the point of proposing that they should not be accepted at Hogwarts. However, when he expressed his opinion to the other Hogwarts founders, they did not agree with him. In response, he left the school, never to return. Slytherin created the Chamber of Secrets, concealing a basilisk, ready to have the Chamber reopened to purge the school of those who, in Slytherin's view, were unworthy to study magic.
                    Slytherin corresponds roughly with the element of water due to serpents being commonly associated with the sea and lochs in western European mythology, as well as serpents being physically fluid and flexible animals.

                    Hufflepuff is one of the four Houses of Houses of Hogwarts School. 
                    Its founder was the medieval witch Helga Hufflepuff. 
                    Hufflepuff is the most inclusive among the four houses; 
                    valuing hard work, dedication, patience, loyalty, and fair play rather than a particular aptitude in its members.
                    The emblematic animal is a badger, and yellow and black are its colours. 
                    Hufflepuff corresponds roughly to the element of earth, 
                    and it is for that reason that the House colours were chosen: 
                    yellow represented wheat, while black was emblematic of soil. 
                    Students sorted into Hufflepuff often demonstrate exceptional abilities in Herbology, 
                    owing to their correspondence to earth.
                    While the other founders took students based on either ambition, bravery, or intelligence, 
                    Helga took the loyal, hard-working, patient and tolerant and treated them all equally. 
                    She had a gift for Food-related charms, and her recipes are still used as the basis for many Hogwarts feasts.  
                    She also arranged for the house-elf contingent to work in the kitchens, 
                    giving them somewhere safe to work, where they would not be mistreated or abused.
